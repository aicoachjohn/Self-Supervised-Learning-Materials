# 🧠 Self-Supervised Learning on Card Images (Educational Demo)

This repository contains an educational implementation of a **self-supervised learning pipeline** on a custom dataset of card images (ID cards, visiting cards, bank cards, etc.).

It is intended **purely for educational and research purposes** — to demonstrate how self-supervised representation learning can be applied on unlabeled image data, and later fine-tuned with a small labeled dataset.

## 📝 Description

### 🔹 `my_card_images/`

This folder contains **unlabeled card images**. These are used for the **self-supervised pretraining stage**, where the model learns general visual features without labels.

### 🔹 `cards_labeled_small/`

This folder contains a **small labeled subset** of images (for example: "voter ID", "visiting card", "bank card", etc.). This is used for **supervised fine-tuning** after self-supervised pretraining.

### 🔹 `self_supervised_demo.py`

This Python script demonstrates:

- How to load the unlabeled images
- Apply self-supervised techniques (e.g., SimCLR, BYOL, or simple contrastive learning)
- Train a feature extractor on the unlabeled data
- Fine-tune on the small labeled dataset
- Evaluate the model
